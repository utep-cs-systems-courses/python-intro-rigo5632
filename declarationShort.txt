WHEN, in the Course of human Events, it becomes necessary for one
People to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with
another, and to assume, among the Powers of the Earth, the separate

entitle them, a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires
that they should declare the Causes which impel them to the
Separation.
